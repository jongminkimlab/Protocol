# General note
- I use half the volume of reagenets than the recommended protocol

# Material
- Competent cells (NEB#C2987)
- SOC/LB media
- Appropriate antibiotics containing LB plates 

# Protocol

1. Thaw cells (NEB#C2987) on the ice.
2. 1uL DNA + 25uL cells, flick
3. Incubate on ice 30min
4. Heat shock 42C for 30sec
5. Incubate on ice for 5min
6. Add 500uL SOC or LB media
7. Incubate at 37C for 1 hour (no need for ampicillin resistance)

  "ampicillin does not kill cells unless they are dividing. So newly transformed cells plated straight onto ampicillin can synthesise the beta-lactamase enzyme required for resistance without any problem" <br>
