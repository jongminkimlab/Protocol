# DNA Purification — Dynabeads SILANE MyOne

Written by ChatGTP. Modified by Jongmin Kim (jk2938@corenll.edu). Last updated 1. 6. 2026

## Goal
Purify DNA (genomic DNA, PCR fragments, plasmids, etc) from a crude lysate using Dynabeads SILANE MyOne magnetic beads.<br>
(for downstream PCR, cloning, or any downstream molecular biology applications).

---

## Materials
- DNA lysate (proteinase K–treated, PCR product, etc)
- **Dynabeads SILANE MyOne**  
- Lysis/Binding Buffer (gDNA)
- 100% Isopropanol
- 80% Ethanol (fresh)
- Nuclease-free water or TE buffer
- Magnetic rack
- 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes or PCR tubes

---

## Protocol

---

### 1. Bind DNA to Beads
- Resuspend **30 µL Dynabeads SILANE MyOne** thoroughly.
- Add beads to lysate (e.g. 30uL of supernatant for fly genomic DNA prep).
- Add **60 µL 100% isopropanol** (equal volume).
- Mix by pipetting 10–12×.
- Incubate **5 min at room temperature**.

---

### 3. Magnetize
- Place tube on magnetic rack.
- Wait **~2 min** until solution clears.

---

### 4. Remove Supernatant
- Carefully remove and discard supernatant.
- Do not disturb bead pellet.

---

### 5. Wash Beads (×2)
- Add **200 µL 80% ethanol** (do not resuspend beads).
- Incubate **30 sec**.
- Remove ethanol completely.
- Repeat once.

---

### 6. Air-Dry Beads
- Leave tube on magnet.
- Air-dry **2~5 min**.
- Avoid over-drying (beads should not crack, or just beginning to crack).

---

### 7. Elute DNA
- Remove tube from magnet.
- Add **10–100 µL elution buffer**. (depending on your desired final concentration).
- Resuspend beads by pipetting 10×.
- Incubate **2 min at room temperature**.

---

### 8. Final Magnet & Transfer
- Place tube on magnet.
- Wait **~1 min**.
- Transfer clear eluate (DNA) to a new tube.

---

## Tips
- Beads must be **fully resuspended** before addition.
- Do not let beads dry excessively — yield drops.
- For low-input samples, reduce Elution Buffer volume.
