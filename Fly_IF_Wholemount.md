- PBST (PBS + 0.05% Triton-X 100)
- PBST BSA (PBST + 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA))
- Antibodies

<br> before fixation-->

1. Fix gently dissected testes with ~500uL 4% formaldehyde in PBS at RT for 15 minutes. 
    > - Rule of thumb: use at least 10 times fixative volume than the tissue volume. So 500uL should be more than sufficient for fly testes.
    > - I fix them 'mostly' stationary. Put them in 2mL tubes, and shake them to mix once or twice during fixation. <br>
    > - I use 16% methanol-free formaldehyde ampoules. <br>
    > - Opened ampoules can be stored at 4C by sealing tightly with parafilm. Okay for 1~2 months.<br>
    > - Probably okay to fix with 1% formaldehyde in PBS, but I have not tested

<summary>CLICK TO OPEN: Note on paraformaldehyde and formaldehyde</summary>

    1) Paraformaldehyde is a polymer form (powder) of formaldehyde. 
       You cannot fix samples with paraformaldehyde, 
       so don't write in your method section that you fixed with paraformaldehyde.

    2) Once you open 16% formaldehyde ampoule, formaldehyde polymerizes. 
       So, the effective concentration of active moiety decreases over time. 
       Empirically, it did not matter to keep opened formaldehyde at 4C for up to 1~2 months.

2. Remove formaldehyde. Wash with PBS - 500mM Tris - PBS -PBS.
    > - 500mM Tris to quench formaldehyde. Usually okay to skip. <br>
    > - You can add the 1x volume of 1M Tris directly to quench. <br>
    > - Testes can be stored in PBS at 4C for couple of hours. <br>
    > - For longer storage, it may be better with some buffer with detergent. You can keep the testes in the blocking step for a few days. <br>

3. Replace buffer with the permeabilization solution (0.2% Triton-X PBS), 500~1000uL for ~30 minutes. Do a quick wash (buffer exchange) with PBST (0.05% Triton-X) after permeabilization.
    > I am still not sure if Sodium Deoxycholate (NaDOC) permeabilization step is strictly necessary. So skipped here.<br>
    > If using NaDOC, make fresh. 0.5% NaDOC in 0.2% Triton-X 100 PBST (e.g. 50mg NaDOC in 10mL PBST)

4. Block testes for 30 minutes at RT with >200uL PBST (0.05% Triton-X 100) 3% BSA. 
    > Block can be ~10 minutes to overnight (at 4C for O/N)

5. Replace >200uL blocking buffer with 1’ Abs in PBST (0.05% Triton-X 100) 3% BSA. Incubate O/N at 4C.
    > - Okay to leave for 2~3 nights. For wholemount, usually longer is better.
    > - I have done 11 weeks primary incubation (don't ask me why) and it worked (very well)!
    > - But as always, how long is optimal depends on your primary antibody. 

6. Wash 3~4 times with >1mL PBST (0.05% Triton-X 100) for ~10 min per wash at RT.
    > I think wash after secondary matters more. 

7. Incubate testes with >200uL 2’ Abs in PBST (0.05% Triton-X 100) 3% BSA. Incubate O/N at 4C.
   > - Most 2' Abs, use in 1:1000.<br>
   > - After adding 2' Abs, keep samples away from light (several minutes fine).<br>
   > - 2 hours at RT incubation is also fine. 

8. Wash 3~4 times with >1mL PBST (0.05% Triton-X 100) for ~10 min per wash at RT (2nd time /w HOECHST (1:10000)).
    > - For wholemount, do not use mounting media with DAPI. <br> Nuclei signal is much clearer by staining DNA during wash step. 

9. Mount: use wide bore tips, transfer testes to slide glass.<br> Arrange testes so that they not to overlap with each other. Wick PBST away. 
<br> Add 10~20uL mounting media. Put 18x18mm or 22x22mm No.1 or No.1.5 coverslip. Seal with nail polish. 

10. Imaging. Try to get 10~20 testes per condition (depending on variability, purpose (publication, quantification, etc)).
