## **Materials**  
- **Fixatives:**  
  - 4% formaldehyde in PBS *(Prepare by diluting 16% formaldehyde stock in PBS)*  
  - Bouin’s fixative *(if applicable)*  
- **Ethanol solutions:**  
  - 30% ethanol  
  - 50% ethanol  
  - 70% ethanol

## **Protocol**  

### **1. Testis Dissection and Fixation**  
1. Dissect testes in cold PBS and carefully remove fat.  
2. Fix testes in either:  
   - **4% formaldehyde in PBS** at **4°C overnight** (on a rocker or rotator), or  
   - **Bouin’s fixative** at **room temperature overnight** (on a rocker or rotator).  
   
   **Notes:**  
   - Ensure the fixative volume is at least **10 times** the tissue volume.  
   - Use ~10 mL of fixative in a **round-bottom tube** to prevent testes from getting stuck at the bottom.  

### **2. Post-Fixation and Dehydration**  
3. After overnight fixation, **breadloaf** the testes (cut in half) and continue fixing for several more hours.  
4. Wash testes **3 times for 20 minutes each** in distilled water (H₂O).  
   
   **Alternative:** A shorter wash (**2 washes of 10 minutes each**) is acceptable.  

5. Dehydrate testes in an ethanol gradient at room temperature:  
   - **30% ethanol** → **2 hours**  
   - **50% ethanol** → **2 hours**  
   - **70% ethanol** → **at least 2 hours**  
   
   **Notes:**  
   - The **30% and 50% ethanol steps can range from 0.5 to 4 hours**, as long as the sample reaches 70% ethanol by the end of the day.  

6. **(For Bouin’s-fixed samples only)** Continue changing the 70% ethanol solution daily until both the solution and testes are no longer yellow.  
   
   **Note:** *Tissues fixed in 4% formaldehyde do not require multiple washes in 70% ethanol.*  

### **3. Sample Submission for Embedding**  
7. Transfer testes to **2 mL tubes** and send them for **paraffin embedding and sectioning**.  
   
   **(!) Use an ethanol-resistant pen to label tubes.**
