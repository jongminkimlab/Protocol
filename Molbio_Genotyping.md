# General note
- If you have good set of primers, you don't need to purify DNA. Just a little bit of lysate is enough.

# Material
- Taq 2x Master Mix  (M0270L), NEB <br><br>
and/or
- iTaq Universal SYBR green super mix, 5000 rxn  (172-5125), BioRad
- Proteinase K, recombinant PCR grade, ~2.5 units/mg protein (3115828001), Sigma 


  > Regular Taq is error-prone, but in my hands, worked best in amplifying the targets.<br>
  > Other Polymerases with proofreading functions were never as good.

- Mouse tissue. 2mm length tail end or 2mm x 2mm ear piece are enough.
  > If you can see the tissue piece, that is big enough to PCR.

- Proteinase K lysis buffer

# Protocol

1. Make lysis buffer + Proteinase K master mix.
    - Empircally, Proteinase K:lysis buffer = 1:30 work well.
    - 2mm tail or 2mm<sup>2</sup> ear piece, 50uL is enough. If tissue size is bigger or smaller, adjust the volume accordingly.
    - Make master mix volume accordinly given number of samples to process.
      
2. Add lysis buffer + Proteinase K to tissues.
   
3. Incubate at 60~70C oven overnight.

4. Vortex and centrifuge ~13000G for ~5 minutes to remove insoluble debris.

5. Take 5uL of supernatant and mix with 500uL water. You will use this crude lysate for PCR reactions.
