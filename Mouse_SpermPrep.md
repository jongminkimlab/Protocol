by Jongmin Kim (jk2938@cornell.edu). Last updated 5. 19. 2025

## Materials and Reagents  
- Dissected **cauda epididymis**  
- **Scissors** (fine dissection scissors)  
- **Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)**  
- **37°C incubator with rotation capability**  
- **Pipettes and tips**  
- **10 µm cell strainer**  
- **Microscope slides**  
- **95% Ethanol (EtOH)**

## Procedure  

### 1. Tissue Processing  
1. Dissect the **cauda epididymis** and place it in a clean Petri dish.  
2. Mince the tissue **10 times** using fine scissors to release sperm.  

### 2.1 Incubation and Sperm Release (non-CASA, use one cauda epididymis) 
3. Transfer the minced tissue to a tube containing **PBS**.
    > put a drop of PBS on minced tissue and aspirate to transfer. 
4. Incubate at **37°C** for **30 minutes** with gentle rotation.  

### 2.2 Incubation and Sperm Release (CASA, use the other cauda epididymis) 
3. Transfer the minced tissue to a tube containing **TYH** media.
    > put a drop of TYH on minced tissue and aspirate to transfer. 
4. Incubate at **37°C** for **30 minutes** with gentle rotation. --> CASA   

### 3. Supernatant Collection & count (Filtration Method)  
5. **Filter the suspension through a 10 µm cell strainer** to remove tissue debris (**Cfg**).
    > This is only required when you want to have pure sperm for biochemical analyses.  
6. Collect the **filtered supernatant** in a clean tube.
7. Dilute and count with hemocytometer (1 min incubation at 60C can kill sperm and make them immobile / or resuspend in water / or light fixing with formaldehyde)

### 4. Slide Preparation  
8. Take **5 µL of the filtered supernatant** and place it onto a microscope slide.  
9. Air-dry the sample.  
10. Fix by immersing in **95% ethanol** using Coplin jar.
    > You can also fix with 1:1 sperm suspension and 4% formaldehyde. 

### 5. Sample Storage  
11. Collect the remaining filtered sample and transfer it to cryogenic vials.  
12. Snap freeze the sample in **liquid nitrogen** or store at **-80°C** for future analysis.

## Notes  
- Filtration through a **10 µm strainer** helps remove large tissue debris while retaining sperm.  
- Fixed slides can be used for **morphological analysis**, **immunostaining**, or counting.  
- The snap-frozen sample can be used for downstream molecular analysis, such as **RNA/protein extraction**.
