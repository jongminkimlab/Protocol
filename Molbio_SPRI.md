# DNA Purification — SPRI Bead Method

Written by ChatGTP. Modified by Jongmin Kim (jk2938@corenll.edu). Last updated 1. 6. 2026

## Goal
Purify DNA (genomic DNA, PCR fragments, plasmids, etc) from a crude lysate using SPRI beads  
(for downstream PCR, cloning, or any downstream molecular biology applications).

---

## Materials
- DNA lysate (proteinase K–treated, PCR product, etc)
- SPRI beads (e.g., Ampure XP or Serapure)
- 80% Ethanol (fresh)
- Nuclease-free water or TE buffer
- Magnetic rack
- 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes or PCR tubes

---

## Buffers

### 80% Ethanol

### Elution Buffer
- Nuclease-free water  
  **or**
- 10mM Tris (no EDTA)

---

## Bead Ratio
- Use **1.0x to 1.8× SPRI beads** relative to lysate volume
    > for genomic DNA or plasmid, 1.0x is enough.<br>
    > for <1kb DNA, I would do 1.8x to be safe.

---

## Protocol

### 1. Prepare Beads
- Bring SPRI beads to room temperature.
- Mix thoroughly until homogeneous.

---

### 2. Bind DNA
- Add **1.0 to 1.8× volume SPRI beads** to lysate.
- Mix by pipetting 10–12×.
- Incubate **5 min at room temperature**.

---

### 3. Magnetize
- Place tube on magnetic rack.
- Wait **~2 min** until solution clears.

---

### 4. Remove Supernatant
- Carefully remove and discard supernatant.
- Do not disturb bead pellet.

---

### 5. Wash Beads (×2)
- Add **200 µL 80% ethanol** (do not resuspend beads).
- Incubate **30 sec**.
- Remove ethanol completely.
- Repeat once.

---

### 6. Air-Dry Beads
- Leave tube on magnet.
- Air-dry **2~5 min**.
- Avoid over-drying (beads should not crack, or just beginning to crack).

---

### 7. Elute DNA
- Remove tube from magnet.
- Add **10–100 µL elution buffer**. (depending on your desired final concentration).
- Resuspend beads by pipetting 10×.
- Incubate **2 min at room temperature**.

---

### 8. Final Magnet & Transfer
- Place tube on magnet.
- Wait **~1 min**.
- Transfer clear eluate (DNA) to a new tube.

---

## Notes
- Larger bead ratios favor retention of higher–molecular weight DNA.
- Avoid vortexing after elution to reduce shearing.
