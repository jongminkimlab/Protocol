### Materials  
- PBS  
- Liquid nitrogen (LN2)
- Dissection equipment 

## Protocol for Testes Collection and Storage for Western Blot

### 1. Liquid Nitrogen Handling
- Obtain an appropriate amount of liquid nitrogen (LN2) based on its evaporation rate:
  - **30 minutes** → **0.25L**
  - **1 hour** → **0.5L**
- Handle LN2 with caution.

### 2. Testes Dissection
- Dissect the appropriate number of testes.
- For Western blot, loading an equal number of testes (e.g. 10 pairs per lane) is often easier than measuring protein concentrations.

### 3. Normalization Considerations
- If normalizing by testes count, ensure consistency:
  - Use testes at a similar developmental stage (avoid very old testes, as they are smaller).
  - Maintain the exact same number of testes per sample.
  - Keep accessory gland inclusion consistent (if included in one sample, include them in all).

### 4. Sample Preparation
- Transfer dissected testes into **1 mL PBS** in a **1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube**.
- Centrifuge at **>15,000G for >1 minute** to pellet the testes.
- Remove as much PBS as possible using a vacuum or pipette.
- Snap-freeze the pellet in LN2.
- Store at **-80°C** (or **-20°C for short-term storage**) until use.
