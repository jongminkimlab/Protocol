## Purpose
To subculture Drosophila S2 cells to maintain healthy growth and avoid overcrowding, ensuring sufficient cells for experiments.

---

## Materials

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| S2 cells | Drosophila Schneider 2 cells in culture |
| Culture medium | Schneider’s medium + 10% FBS + antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) <br> or <br> M3+BPYE media (see [DGRC](https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/include/file/TissueCultureMedium.pdf)) + 10% FBS + antibiotics |
| 25 cm² or 75 cm² tissue culture flask | depending on scale |
| Sterile pipettes / serological pipette | 5 mL, 10 mL, etc. |
| 15 or 50 mL conical tube | for pelleting, if needed |
| Centrifuge | capable of ~500 x g |
| Hemocytometer or automated cell counter | to count cells |
| Temperature‐controlled incubator | 25 °C (non-CO₂) |

---

## Protocol

> JK: For a lazy split, you can pipette the cells up and down to resuspend, then dilute 1:5 and seed into a new flask without counting or pelleting.


1. **Check cell density & health**  
   - Under a microscope, inspect morphology: cells should be round to oval, free-floating, no large clumps.  
   - If culture is more than ~70-80% confluent (or density > 5 × 10⁶ cells/mL), passage.

2. **Harvest cells**  
   - Gently swirl flask to suspend cells.  
   - Transfer appropriate volume of cell suspension into 15 mL conical tube.  

3. **Pellet cells** (optional, if media needs replacement or debris removal)  
   - Centrifuge at ~500 × g for 5 minutes at room temperature.  
   - Discard supernatant carefully without disturbing pellet.

4. **Resuspend cells**  
   - Add fresh, prewarmed culture medium to desired volume.  
   - Gently pipette to break up clumps.

5. **Seed new flask / adjust density**  
   - For maintenance: seed cells to ~0.5‐1 × 10⁶ cells/mL.  
   - For expansion: adjust seeding density appropriately.

6. **Incubate**  
   - Place flask in incubator (25 °C). No CO₂ needed.  
   - Monitor growth every ~24 hours. Passage approx every 2-3 days depending on growth rate.

## Notes / Tips

- Avoid overgrowth; high density reduces viability and increases cell debris.  
- If lots of debris is present, a centrifugation and media change helps.  
- Use aseptic technique throughout to avoid contamination.  
- Rotate flask gently to avoid settling of cells.

# S2 Cell Freeze-Down

**Last updated:** 2025-09-23  
**Author:** ChatGPT, reviewed and modified by Jongmin Kim (jk2938@cornell.edu)

---

## Purpose
To cryopreserve S2 cells so that stocks can be stored long-term and recovered later with high viability.

---

## Materials

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| S2 cells | Healthy log-phase culture (~1-2 × 10⁶ cells/mL) |
| Freezing medium | Schneider’s medium + 10% FBS + 10% DMSO <br> or <br> M3+BPYE media (see [DGRC](https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/include/file/TissueCultureMedium.pdf)) + 10% FBS + 10% DMSO |
| Sterile centrifuge tubes | 15 or 50 mL conical tubes |
| Cryovials | 1.0 or 2.0 mL, sterile, labeled |
| Centrifuge | ~500 × g |
| Water bath | 37 °C (for thawing later) |
| Mr. Frosty or other isopropanol freezing container or just a styroform box | for ~ -1 °C/min cooling rate |
| -80 °C freezer |
| Liquid nitrogen storage (long-term) | optional but preferred |

---

## Protocol

> JK: 5~10 vials per T75 flask

1. **Prepare cells**  
   - Grow S2 cells to mid-log phase (healthy, actively dividing).  
   - Check density: ~1-2 × 10⁶ cells/mL.

2. **Harvest cells**  
   - Transfer culture to centrifuge tube.  
   - Spin at ~500 × g for 5 min at room temperature.  
   - Discard supernatant. (some use 45% conditioned media, 45% new media, 10% DMSO)

3. **Resuspend in freezing medium**  
   - Gently resuspend cell pellet in freezing medium (pre-cooled, if possible) to a final concentration of ~1-5 × 10⁷ cells/mL.

4. **Aliquot into cryovials**  
   - Transfer ~1 mL per vial (or appropriate volume) into labeled cryovials.  
   - Label with date, cell line, passage number, and initials.

5. **Cool down slowly**  
   - Place cryovials into Mr. Frosty (or equivalent) to achieve approx. -1 °C/min cooling in a -80 °C freezer.  
   - Leave for at least 4-6 hours (overnight is fine) to reach -80 °C.

6. **Transfer to long-term storage**  
   - After initial cooling, transfer vials into liquid nitrogen (if available) for long-term storage.  
   - If only using -80 °C, ensure freezer is stable and backup plans in place.

---

## Notes / Tips

- Use freshly prepared DMSO containing freezing medium; DMSO is toxic, so work quickly.  
- Avoid large clumps—cells should be well dispersed before freezing to improve thaw survival.  
- Always have duplicate vials in storage at different locations if possible.  
- Record all relevant metadata (cell density, passage number, freezing medium composition).

# S2 Cell Thawing & Starting Culture

## Purpose
To recover frozen S2 cells and establish a healthy culture.

---

## Materials

| Item | Details |
|---|---|
| Frozen S2 cells | Stored in liquid nitrogen |
| Complete culture medium | Schneider’s medium + 10% FBS + antibiotics <br> or <br> M3+BPYE media (see [DGRC](https://dgrc.bio.indiana.edu/include/file/TissueCultureMedium.pdf)) + 10% FBS + antibiotics |
| 15or 50 mL conical tube | for washing cells |
| Centrifuge | ~500 × g |
| Water bath | 37 °C |
| Tissue culture flask | T25 or T75 |
| Sterile pipettes | 5–10 mL |

## Protocol

1. **Thaw quickly**  
   - Remove cryovial from liquid nitrogen.  
   - Thaw rapidly in 37 °C water bath (1–2 min) until a small ice chunk remains.  
   - Wipe vial with 70% ethanol before bringing into hood.  

2. **Dilute DMSO**  
   - Transfer contents to 15 or 50 mL conical tube with 9 mL pre-warmed complete medium.  
   - Mix gently.  

3. **Centrifuge**  
   - Spin at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet cells.  
   - Carefully discard supernatant (contains DMSO).  

4. **Resuspend**  
   - Add 5–10 mL fresh medium to pellet and resuspend gently.  

5. **Seed culture**  
   - Transfer to a T25 flask (or T75 for larger recovery).  
   - Place at 25 °C incubator.  

6. **Monitor growth**  
   - Check next day under microscope.  
   - Passage as usual once density reaches ~5 × 10⁶ cells/mL.

## Notes

- Thaw as fast as possible to minimize DMSO toxicity.  
- Always remove DMSO by centrifugation before starting culture.  
- Recovery may take 1–2 days before normal doubling resumes.
