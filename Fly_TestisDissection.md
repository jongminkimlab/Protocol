1. With my left forceps, grab the thorax. I like to fold its wing so that I can expose the abdomen.

3. Make a nick right before the last segment by poking and opening the forceps motion.

4. Grab the last segment from the lower side of the abdomen, and pull the testes with the gut.

5. Be careful not to take the entire abdomen. It will be easiest when you just take the testes and gut by pulling the last segment.

6. If you are experienced, the ejaculatory duct has a noticeable shape. I grab the ejaculatory duct.

7. Separate the testes + accessory glands, + ejaculatory duct from the gut by pulling the ejaculatory duct.

8. To separate tests from accessory glands and the ejaculatory duct, I grab a seminal vesicle and take testes.
