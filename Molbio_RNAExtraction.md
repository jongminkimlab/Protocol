# Protocol

## Trizol based phase separation

* Handle Trizol and chloroform in the fume hood. 

0. Store cells or tissues by snap freezing in liquid nitrogen to minimize RNA degradation. 
    > You can also store samples in Trizol and snap freeze. 

1. Homogenize in 500ul~1000uL Trizol (>10x Trizol volume than the cell pellet or tissue size)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I use blue pestle that fits 1.5mL test tubes, then use syringe going through 23G -> 25G needle >10 times each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- You can use small (1mL) Dounce homogenizer, too.
    > (!) Thorough homogenization is critical for RNA yield for tissues.<br>
    >     Hard tissues may require grinding them in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle.<br>
    >     Skip syringe homogenization step for cultured cells or already dissociated cells from tissues. Instead pipette up&down several times.<br>
    >  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    > Fly testis: assume 300~500ng total RNA / 1 pair of testis, use 500uL Trizol 23G -> 25G -> 27G (if 27G possible)
    

2. Add 100ul of chloroform (20% of original Trizol vol.). Shake vigorously for 15 seconds
 
3. Leave at room temp for 2-3 minutes
 
4. Spin at 4C, ~13000G for 15min
 
5. Transfer aqueous layer to fresh tube.
    > Usually between 2~300uL (supposed to be ~60% of original Trizol vol. but usually less than that especially for tissues).<br><br>
    > (!) From here, you need to worry about RNA degradation by RNases. <br>
    > (!) I don't use DEPC, RNAse Zap, etc. Try to use clean solutions, use filtered tips, and try not to chat while working on RNA.<br>
    > (!) It will be safer to assume you have RNase in your solution, and keep things at 4C to minimize RNase activity. 
    

6. Using the aqueous phase, you can either precipitate, or perform additional column based purification. 
    > I get less RNA by going through additional column, but I think I get purer RNA using columns. <br>
    > Subsequent reactions work better after additional column step. 

## Column based purficiation

* You can use any RNA purification columns.<br>

<b>[e.g. 1) Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator] </b>
1. Add 2 volumes of RNA Binding Buffer to each sample and mix
    > *Mix 100uL buffer and 50uL sample.*
2. Add an equal volume of ethanol (95-100%) and mix
    > * Add 150uL ethanol.
3. Transfer the sample to the Zymo-Spin IC Column in a Collection Tube and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.

4. Add 400uL of RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.

5. Add 700uL of RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.

6. Add 400uL of RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge. Discard the flow-through.

7. Place column on a new 2mL tubes. Cfg. at full speed 1min.

8. Add 10~100uL DNase/RNase-Free Water directly to the column matrix and centrifuge. 

<b>[e.g. 2) Qiagen RNA Cleanup]</b>
1. Add equal volume of 70% EtOH
 
2. Transfer up to 700uL of sample to RNeasy Mini spin column. Cfg. 15sec >8000g
 
3. Add 350uL buffer RW1. Cfg. 15sec >8000g.
 
4. Add 500uL buffer RPE. Cfg. 15sec >8000g.
 
5. Add 500uL buffer RPE. Cfg. 15sec >8000g. 
 
6. Place column on a new 2mL tubes. Cfg. at full speed 1min.  
 
7. Place column in a new 1.5mL collection tubes. 30~50uL H2O. Cfg. 1min >8000g.


## check purified RNA yield and quality

1. Use nanodrop to check RNA yield and impurities.
    > Absorbance profiles are good to check impurities. Concentration reliable at >20ng/uL.
    
2. Use Tapestation(Bioanalyzer) to check RNA yield and quality (distinct 18S, 28S peaks).
    > Because RNA signal is concentrated at rRNA peaks, in some ways, the most sensitive. 

3. Use Qubit to check RNA yield.
    > Still reliable even at <20ng/uL.
